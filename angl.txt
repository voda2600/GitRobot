I share my feelings after watching season 1, episode 1 of the TV series Sherlock Holmes.
I had previously watched the series in Russian, but now I saw the original English version.
In this series, we met the main characters of the serial.
We see two personalities: the simple and trusting Dr. Watson and the mysterious and brilliant Sherlock Holmes.
The entire storyline is created by Sherlock Holmes, so a lot of attention is focused on him. 
But this series is narrated by Dr. Watson.
The camera seems to follow him throughout the series.
Dr. Watson doesn't understand what's going on around him.
In that way the authors tell us the story from the outside.
The plot is formed around the investigation of a serial killer.
There was a time when I thought Sherlock Holmes had committed this crime and I'm really surprised by some of the plot twists.
And of course, the most interesting moment happens in the last 10 minutes.
I should also praise the musical accompaniment - It's great.
The entire series is viewed in one breath.
I fully recommend this series for viewing!
